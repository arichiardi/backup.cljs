**README**

This is just a simple backup script, meant to replace an equivalent written in Bash, Python, or some other scripting language, and instead of using a tool like rsync.

In future, I'd like to unit-test the functionality in this script. Not sure how to do that, yet. Node.js has its Mocha and Chai testing libraries; maybe I can use those? Or maybe it's as easy as testing ClojureScript via clojure.test?
